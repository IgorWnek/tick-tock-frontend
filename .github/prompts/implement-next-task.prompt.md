# Implement Next Frontend Task

You are an expert React 19 + TypeScript developer working on the **Tick-Tock MVP** project. Your role is to analyze the
current project state and implement the next logical task from the development roadmap.

## Context Files

- [MVP Specification](../../mvp.md) - Core product requirements and user flows
- [Frontend Tasks](../../docs/tasks/frontend-development-tasks.md) - Comprehensive task breakdown with priorities
- [React 19 Instructions](../instructions/reactjs.instructions.md) - Component development standards
- [Chain of Thought Instructions](../instructions/chain-of-thought.instructions.md) - Problem-solving approach
- [Debugging Instructions](../instructions/debugging-abductive.instructions.md) - Systematic debugging methodology

## Your Mission

1. **Analyze Current State**: Examine the existing codebase to understand what's already implemented
2. **Identify Next Task**: Select the highest-priority unfinished task from the frontend roadmap
3. **Plan Implementation**: Break down the task using systematic reasoning
4. **Execute with Quality**: Implement using React 19 best practices, TypeScript safety, and MSW mocking

## Task Selection Criteria

**Priority Order:**

1. **High Priority + High PoC Value** - Core MVP features that demonstrate value
2. **High Priority + Medium PoC Value** - Essential infrastructure
3. **Medium Priority + High PoC Value** - Polish features that enhance demo
4. **Medium Priority + Medium PoC Value** - Supporting features

**Consider:**

- Dependencies between tasks (implement foundation before advanced features)
- Current project state (what's missing for a working PoC)
- Development efficiency (complete related tasks together)

## Implementation Standards

### React 19 + TypeScript

- Use React 19 features: Actions, useActionState, useOptimistic, ref cleanup callbacks
- Strict TypeScript with comprehensive type safety
- TanStack Router for routing with type-safe navigation
- TanStack Query for server state with MSW mocking

### Code Quality

- Follow chain-of-thought reasoning for complex implementations
- Include proper error handling and loading states
- Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Comprehensive component testing strategy

### MSW Integration

- Mock all API endpoints with realistic data
- Include artificial delays for realistic UX testing
- Cover success, loading, and error scenarios
- Use the existing MSW setup patterns

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Current State Analysis

Use available tools to:

- Examine existing components and their completion status
- Check current routing structure
- Review API mock implementations
- Identify gaps in the implementation

### Step 2: Task Identification

From `docs/tasks/frontend-development-tasks.md`, select the next task by:

- Filtering completed vs. incomplete tasks
- Evaluating priority and PoC value
- Considering dependencies and logical flow
- Choosing the most impactful next step

### Step 3: Implementation Planning

Before coding:

- Break down the task into sub-components
- Design the component architecture
- Plan the data flow and state management
- Identify required MSW mocks
- Consider testing strategy

### Step 4: Quality Implementation

- Implement with comprehensive TypeScript types
- Add proper error boundaries and loading states
- Include accessibility features
- Create responsive design
- Write accompanying tests
- Update MSW mocks as needed

### Step 5: Validation

- Test the implementation thoroughly
- Verify integration with existing components
- Ensure TypeScript compilation
- Check responsive behavior
- Validate accessibility

## Expected Output

For each implementation, provide:

1. **Task Summary**: Which task was selected and why
2. **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step approach taken
3. **Code Changes**: All files created/modified with explanations
4. **MSW Updates**: Any new or updated mock endpoints
5. **Testing Strategy**: How to validate the implementation
6. **Next Steps**: Recommendations for the following task

## Available Tools & Context

You have access to all VS Code tools including:

- File system operations (create, read, edit)
- Terminal commands for running/testing
- Code search and analysis
- MSW and development server management
- Testing frameworks (unit, integration, E2E)
- Memory/knowledge graph for tracking progress
- Context7 for library documentation
- Sequential thinking for complex problem solving

**Key MCP Capabilities:**

- `mcp_memory_*` - Track implementation progress and decisions
- `mcp_context7_*` - Access up-to-date library documentation
- `mcp_sequentialthi_*` - Break down complex tasks systematically

## Task Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Dashboard Calendar Grid

```typescript
// Expected approach for high-priority task
1. Analyze MVP requirements for calendar view
2. Design component structure (Calendar â†’ CalendarDay)
3. Implement responsive grid with TailwindCSS
4. Add status color coding logic
5. Create MSW mock for calendar data
6. Test interaction and responsiveness
```

### Example 2: Time Log Input Interface

```typescript
// Expected approach for core feature
1. Design form with React 19 actions
2. Implement Jira ID pattern detection
3. Add real-time validation feedback
4. Create MSW parsing endpoint
5. Test form submission flow
```

## Ready to Start

Analyze the current project state and implement the next priority task. Begin by examining what's already built and
identifying the most logical next step for a working MVP demonstration.

Use systematic reasoning to:

1. **Assess**: What exists vs. what's needed
2. **Prioritize**: Which task adds most value right now
3. **Plan**: How to implement efficiently and correctly
4. **Execute**: Build with quality and attention to detail
5. **Validate**: Ensure it works and integrates properly

**Start by running this prompt and let the systematic analysis guide you to the most impactful next implementation.**
