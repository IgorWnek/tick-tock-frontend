# Implement Authentication System Task

You are an expert React 19 + TypeScript developer working on the **Tick-Tock MVP** authentication system. Your role is to implement a specific main task from the authentication roadmap with **strict sequential execution** of sub-tasks and **complete adherence** to all requirements and success criteria.

## Context Files

- [Authentication Tasks](../../docs/tasks/authentication-system-tasks.md) - Complete task breakdown with priorities and requirements
- [Atomic Design Instructions](../instructions/atomic-design.instructions.md) - Component organization and hierarchy (CRITICAL)
- [React Core Instructions](../instructions/react-core.instructions.md) - React 19 + TypeScript fundamentals
- [React 19 Features](../instructions/react19-features.instructions.md) - Modern React patterns and features
- [Design System Instructions](../instructions/design-system.instructions.md) - Design tokens and consistency
- [Testing Instructions](../instructions/testing.instructions.md) - Component testing strategy
- [Accessibility Instructions](../instructions/accessibility.instructions.md) - WCAG compliance requirements
- [Data Fetching Organisms](../instructions/data-fetching-organisms.instructions.md) - Forms and complex components

## Your Mission

**USER MUST SPECIFY**: The main task to implement (e.g., "### 1. Design System Foundation Setup")

Your systematic approach:

1. **Parse Main Task**: Analyze the specified main task and identify all sub-tasks
2. **Sequential Execution**: Implement sub-tasks ONE AT A TIME in the exact order listed
3. **Requirements Compliance**: Satisfy ALL requirements, design requirements, and definitions of done
4. **Quality Validation**: Verify every checklist item before proceeding
5. **Progress Tracking**: Update status and identify next sub-task

## Critical Implementation Rules

### ðŸš¨ MANDATORY COMPLIANCE AREAS

**Success Criteria**: Every main task has success criteria that MUST be achieved before completion.

**Sub-task Requirements**: Each sub-task has specific requirements that are NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- **Requirements** section â†’ Must be fully implemented
- **Design Requirements** section â†’ Must be followed exactly (for UI components)
- **Specific Actions** â†’ Must be executed as specified

**Definition of Done**: Every checklist item must be completed:
- **Definition of Done** â†’ Technical implementation requirements
- **Design Definition of Done** â†’ Visual and UX requirements (for UI components)

**Sequential Order**: Sub-tasks must be implemented in the exact order they appear. Do NOT skip ahead.

### ðŸŽ¯ Authentication-Specific Standards

**Atomic Design Migration**:
- Components migrate from `src/components/ui/` to `src/design-system/atoms/`
- Each component requires 4 files: `.tsx`, `.types.ts`, `.test.tsx`, `index.ts`
- **Named exports only** - NO default exports in design system
- Maintain 100% API compatibility during migration

**Component Structure**:
```
src/design-system/atoms/ComponentName/
â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentName.tsx          # Main implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentName.types.ts     # TypeScript interfaces
â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentName.test.tsx     # Comprehensive tests
â””â”€â”€ index.ts                   # Named exports only
```

**Design System Integration**:
- Use CVA (Class Variance Authority) for component variants
- Integrate with design tokens for colors, spacing, typography
- Follow WCAG AA accessibility standards (4.5:1 contrast minimum)
- Include ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management

**TypeScript Standards**:
- Strict type safety with comprehensive interfaces
- Proper prop type definitions with VariantProps where applicable
- Error handling and validation types

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Task Analysis and Sub-task Identification

**Required Actions**:
1. **Parse the main task** specified by the user
2. **Extract all sub-tasks** in their exact order
3. **Identify the FIRST incomplete sub-task** (never skip ahead)
4. **Analyze requirements** for the selected sub-task:
   - Requirements section
   - Design Requirements (if present)
   - Specific Actions
   - Definition of Done
   - Design Definition of Done (if present)

### Step 2: Requirements Deep Dive

**Before any implementation**:
1. **List ALL requirements** that must be satisfied
2. **Identify success criteria** for the sub-task
3. **Note design constraints** and accessibility requirements
4. **Plan file structure** according to atomic design principles
5. **Verify dependencies** (existing files, imports, etc.)

### Step 3: Implementation Execution

**Implementation Standards**:
- **React 19**: Use modern features (Actions, useActionState, ref cleanup)
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing with comprehensive interfaces
- **Atomic Design**: Proper component hierarchy and structure
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance with proper ARIA
- **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage of all scenarios
- **Design Tokens**: Integration with design system variables

**File Creation Process**:
1. Create directory structure first
2. Implement main component with proper TypeScript types
3. Create comprehensive test coverage
4. Set up proper exports and imports
5. Verify integration with existing components

### Step 4: Validation and Quality Assurance

**MANDATORY CHECKS** (before proceeding to next sub-task):
1. **TypeScript compilation** passes without errors
2. **All Definition of Done items** are checked âœ…
3. **All Design Definition of Done items** are verified âœ…
4. **Requirements section** is completely satisfied
5. **Component imports** work from new locations
6. **Tests pass** and cover all specified scenarios
7. **Accessibility features** are implemented and functional
8. **File structure** matches atomic design principles exactly

### Step 5: Progress Tracking and Next Steps

**Status Documentation**:
1. **Mark completed items** with âœ… in Definition of Done
2. **Document what was implemented** with specific details
3. **Identify the next sub-task** to be implemented
4. **Note any dependencies** for future sub-tasks
5. **Verify overall progress** toward main task success criteria

## Implementation Quality Standards

### React 19 + TypeScript Excellence

- Use React 19 Actions for form submissions and mutations
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Leverage useActionState for form state management
- Use ref callback cleanup for proper resource management
- Comprehensive TypeScript with strict null checks

### Atomic Design Compliance

- **Atoms**: Single, indivisible UI elements (Button, Input, Label, Avatar)
- **Molecules**: Simple combinations of atoms (FormField, UserInfo)
- **Organisms**: Complex UI components (LoginForm, UserMenu)
- **Templates**: Page layouts and structure
- **Tokens**: Design system variables and constants

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Every component with all scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions and data flow
- **Accessibility Tests**: ARIA, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Visual Tests**: Responsive behavior and design token integration

## Expected Output Format

For each sub-task implementation, provide:

### 1. Sub-task Analysis
```
**Selected Sub-task**: [Sub-task number and title]
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low] | **Effort**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Type**: [Foundation/Migration/New Feature/Enhancement]

**Requirements to Satisfy**:
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2
- [ ] Design Requirement 1 (if applicable)
- [ ] Design Requirement 2 (if applicable)
```

### 2. Implementation Plan
```
**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Step 1 with specific actions
2. Step 2 with file structure
3. Step 3 with component details
4. Step 4 with testing approach
5. Step 5 with validation criteria
```

### 3. Code Implementation
- All files created/modified with complete implementations
- Proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Comprehensive error handling
- Accessibility features included
- Design token integration

### 4. Validation Results
```
**Definition of Done Verification**:
- [âœ…] Item 1 completed and verified
- [âœ…] Item 2 completed and verified
- [âœ…] Item 3 completed and verified

**Design Definition of Done Verification** (if applicable):
- [âœ…] Visual requirement 1 verified
- [âœ…] Accessibility requirement 1 verified
- [âœ…] Brand consistency verified
```

### 5. Progress Status
```
**Completed**: [What was implemented]
**Next Sub-task**: [Next sub-task to implement]
**Overall Progress**: [X of Y sub-tasks completed for main task]
**Success Criteria Status**: [Progress toward main task success criteria]
```

## Critical Success Factors

### ðŸŽ¯ Quality Gates

**Before marking any sub-task complete**:
1. ALL Definition of Done items must be âœ…
2. TypeScript compilation must pass
3. All tests must pass
4. Component must be importable from correct location
5. Accessibility requirements must be verified
6. Design requirements must be visually confirmed

### ðŸš¨ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Skipping sub-tasks**: Always implement in exact sequential order
- **Incomplete requirements**: Every requirement must be satisfied
- **Default exports**: Use named exports only in design system
- **Missing accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard support are mandatory
- **Inadequate testing**: Cover all scenarios specified in Definition of Done
- **Design token neglect**: Must integrate with design system variables

## Ready to Execute

**To use this prompt**:

1. **Specify the main task** you want to implement (copy the exact heading from authentication-system-tasks.md)
2. **Let the agent analyze** the task structure and requirements
3. **Review the implementation plan** before execution begins
4. **Verify each sub-task completion** against all requirements
5. **Proceed sequentially** through all sub-tasks until main task success criteria are met

**Example Usage**:
```
Please implement: ### 1. Design System Foundation Setup

Ensure all sub-tasks are completed sequentially with full requirements compliance.
```

The agent will systematically work through each sub-task, ensuring complete adherence to all requirements, design standards, and success criteria before moving to the next step.
