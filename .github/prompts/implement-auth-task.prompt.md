# Implement Authentication System Task

You are an expert React 19 + TypeScript developer working on the **Tick-Tock MVP** authentication system. Your role is to implement a specific main task from the authentication roadmap with **strict sequential execution** of sub-tasks and **complete adherence** to all requirements and success criteria.

## Context Files

- [Authentication Tasks](../../docs/tasks/authentication-system-tasks.md) - Complete task breakdown with priorities and requirements
- [Atomic Design Instructions](../instructions/atomic-design.instructions.md) - Component organization and hierarchy (CRITICAL)
- [React Core Instructions](../instructions/react-core.instructions.md) - React 19 + TypeScript fundamentals
- [React 19 Features](../instructions/react19-features.instructions.md) - Modern React patterns and features
- [Design System Instructions](../instructions/design-system.instructions.md) - Design tokens and consistency
- [Testing Instructions](../instructions/testing.instructions.md) - Component testing strategy
- [Accessibility Instructions](../instructions/accessibility.instructions.md) - WCAG compliance requirements
- [Data Fetching Organisms](../instructions/data-fetching-organisms.instructions.md) - Forms and complex components

## Your Mission

**USER MUST SPECIFY**: The main task to implement (e.g., "### 1. Design System Foundation Setup")

Your systematic approach:

1. **Parse Main Task**: Analyze the specified main task and identify all sub-tasks
2. **Sequential Execution**: Implement sub-tasks ONE AT A TIME in the exact order listed
3. **Requirements Compliance**: Satisfy ALL requirements, design requirements, and definitions of done
4. **Quality Validation**: Verify every checklist item before proceeding
5. **Progress Tracking**: Update status and identify next sub-task

## Critical Implementation Rules

### 🚨 MANDATORY COMPLIANCE AREAS

**Success Criteria**: Every main task has success criteria that MUST be achieved before completion.

**Sub-task Requirements**: Each sub-task has specific requirements that are NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- **Requirements** section → Must be fully implemented
- **Design Requirements** section → Must be followed exactly (for UI components)
- **Specific Actions** → Must be executed as specified

**Definition of Done**: Every checklist item must be completed:
- **Definition of Done** → Technical implementation requirements
- **Design Definition of Done** → Visual and UX requirements (for UI components)

**Sequential Order**: Sub-tasks must be implemented in the exact order they appear. Do NOT skip ahead.

### 🎯 Authentication-Specific Standards

**Atomic Design Migration**:
- Components migrate from `src/components/ui/` to `src/design-system/atoms/`
- Each component requires 4 files: `.tsx`, `.types.ts`, `.test.tsx`, `index.ts`
- **Named exports only** - NO default exports in design system
- Maintain 100% API compatibility during migration

**Component Structure**:
```
src/design-system/atoms/ComponentName/
├── ComponentName.tsx          # Main implementation
├── ComponentName.types.ts     # TypeScript interfaces
├── ComponentName.test.tsx     # Comprehensive tests
└── index.ts                   # Named exports only
```

**Design System Integration**:
- Use CVA (Class Variance Authority) for component variants
- Integrate with design tokens for colors, spacing, typography
- Follow WCAG AA accessibility standards (4.5:1 contrast minimum)
- Include ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management

**TypeScript Standards**:
- Strict type safety with comprehensive interfaces
- Proper prop type definitions with VariantProps where applicable
- Error handling and validation types

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Task Analysis and Sub-task Identification

**Required Actions**:
1. **Parse the main task** specified by the user
2. **Extract all sub-tasks** in their exact order
3. **Identify the FIRST incomplete sub-task** (never skip ahead)
4. **Analyze requirements** for the selected sub-task:
   - Requirements section
   - Design Requirements (if present)
   - Specific Actions
   - Definition of Done
   - Design Definition of Done (if present)

### Step 2: Requirements Deep Dive

**Before any implementation**:
1. **List ALL requirements** that must be satisfied
2. **Identify success criteria** for the sub-task
3. **Note design constraints** and accessibility requirements
4. **Plan file structure** according to atomic design principles
5. **Verify dependencies** (existing files, imports, etc.)

### Step 3: Implementation Execution

**Implementation Standards**:
- **React 19**: Use modern features (Actions, useActionState, ref cleanup)
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing with comprehensive interfaces
- **Atomic Design**: Proper component hierarchy and structure
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance with proper ARIA
- **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage of all scenarios
- **Design Tokens**: Integration with design system variables

**File Creation Process**:
1. Create directory structure first
2. Implement main component with proper TypeScript types
3. Create comprehensive test coverage
4. Set up proper exports and imports
5. Verify integration with existing components

### Step 4: Validation and Quality Assurance

**MANDATORY CHECKS** (before proceeding to next sub-task):
1. **TypeScript compilation** passes without errors
2. **All Definition of Done items** are checked ✅
3. **All Design Definition of Done items** are verified ✅
4. **Requirements section** is completely satisfied
5. **Component imports** work from new locations
6. **Tests pass** and cover all specified scenarios
7. **Accessibility features** are implemented and functional
8. **File structure** matches atomic design principles exactly

### Step 5: Progress Tracking and Next Steps

**Status Documentation**:
1. **Mark completed items** with ✅ in Definition of Done
2. **Document what was implemented** with specific details
3. **Identify the next sub-task** to be implemented
4. **Note any dependencies** for future sub-tasks
5. **Verify overall progress** toward main task success criteria

## Implementation Quality Standards

### React 19 + TypeScript Excellence

- Use React 19 Actions for form submissions and mutations
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Leverage useActionState for form state management
- Use ref callback cleanup for proper resource management
- Comprehensive TypeScript with strict null checks

### Atomic Design Compliance

- **Atoms**: Single, indivisible UI elements (Button, Input, Label, Avatar)
- **Molecules**: Simple combinations of atoms (FormField, UserInfo)
- **Organisms**: Complex UI components (LoginForm, UserMenu)
- **Templates**: Page layouts and structure
- **Tokens**: Design system variables and constants

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Every component with all scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions and data flow
- **Accessibility Tests**: ARIA, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Visual Tests**: Responsive behavior and design token integration

## Expected Output Format

For each sub-task implementation, provide:

### 1. Sub-task Analysis
```
**Selected Sub-task**: [Sub-task number and title]
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low] | **Effort**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Type**: [Foundation/Migration/New Feature/Enhancement]

**Requirements to Satisfy**:
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2
- [ ] Design Requirement 1 (if applicable)
- [ ] Design Requirement 2 (if applicable)
```

### 2. Implementation Plan
```
**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Step 1 with specific actions
2. Step 2 with file structure
3. Step 3 with component details
4. Step 4 with testing approach
5. Step 5 with validation criteria
```

### 3. Code Implementation
- All files created/modified with complete implementations
- Proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Comprehensive error handling
- Accessibility features included
- Design token integration

### 4. Validation Results
```
**Definition of Done Verification**:
- [✅] Item 1 completed and verified
- [✅] Item 2 completed and verified
- [✅] Item 3 completed and verified

**Design Definition of Done Verification** (if applicable):
- [✅] Visual requirement 1 verified
- [✅] Accessibility requirement 1 verified
- [✅] Brand consistency verified
```

### 5. Progress Status
```
**Completed**: [What was implemented]
**Next Sub-task**: [Next sub-task to implement]
**Overall Progress**: [X of Y sub-tasks completed for main task]
**Success Criteria Status**: [Progress toward main task success criteria]
```

## Critical Success Factors

### 🎯 Quality Gates

**Before marking any sub-task complete**:
1. ALL Definition of Done items must be ✅
2. TypeScript compilation must pass
3. All tests must pass
4. Component must be importable from correct location
5. Accessibility requirements must be verified
6. Design requirements must be visually confirmed

### 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Skipping sub-tasks**: Always implement in exact sequential order
- **Incomplete requirements**: Every requirement must be satisfied
- **Default exports**: Use named exports only in design system
- **Missing accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard support are mandatory
- **Inadequate testing**: Cover all scenarios specified in Definition of Done
- **Design token neglect**: Must integrate with design system variables

## Ready to Execute

**To use this prompt**:

1. **Specify the main task** you want to implement (copy the exact heading from authentication-system-tasks.md)
2. **Let the agent analyze** the task structure and requirements
3. **Review the implementation plan** before execution begins
4. **Verify each sub-task completion** against all requirements
5. **Proceed sequentially** through all sub-tasks until main task success criteria are met

**Example Usage**:
```
Please implement: ### 1. Design System Foundation Setup

Ensure all sub-tasks are completed sequentially with full requirements compliance.
```

The agent will systematically work through each sub-task, ensuring complete adherence to all requirements, design standards, and success criteria before moving to the next step.
